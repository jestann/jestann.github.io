I am a full stack web developer, inspired by new technology and drawn to the connection between people and machines. 

I have experience with the React and Angular frameworks as well as the Node/Express/MongoDB and Ruby on Rails stacks. I went to graduate school in business, but I also have a minor in Mathematics. I've done coursework in algorithms, computer architecture, statistics, and circuitry, and I did graduate level work in business strategy, marketing, and finance. I also have a background in dance, theater, and writing. 

I'm interested in using all this to build powerful, responsive web applications. To me, tech is a fascinating blend of math and art, people and machines, creativity and ubiquity. It's art meets math meets plastic. It asks for innovation but it also demands being extremely practical. Itâ€™s a powerhouse of creative connection-making... and that is why I love it.
