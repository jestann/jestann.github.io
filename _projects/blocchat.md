## Introduction

People need to talk. And I wanted to facilitate that by designing a web chat application using an AngularJS front-end and a Firebase back-end.


## But Why?

_I tend to see everything in terms of stories._

It must be how I'm wired, since I haven't been able to change it. It makes ordinary encounters with life both interesting and exhausting.

When I see an empty cup and plate on the only open table I'm aggressively claiming at a cafe in order to write this case study, I'm curious who ordered it. And why did they leave? Is there a dearth of potential creativity at this particular table? Or did they just have to catch a bus to a job they garnered while sitting there writing a case study in that exact seat?

While I'm scanning the freezer section of the natural foods store, looking for gluten-free dairy-free frozen pizza and glazed donuts because I'm too tired to cook, I wonder: who was the crusader who first scanned these aisles and found them wanting? And what led them to choose creating unhealthy healthy food as their raison d'etre?

When I sneak late into a room full of analytics enthusiasts, all invested in watching someone explain how Taylor polynomial approximations actually do have value outside of increasing the character-per-page density of math textbooks, I get excited. After all, I knew about it in advance and went. Because who _isn't_ excited by Taylor polynomials? Errr, I mean the sheer diversity of human experience?

People have interesting stories to tell, and they are everywhere. The stories and the people.

And the same thing holds true for one's encounters with inanimate objects. They happen everywhere. Unavoidably. Meaningfully. Because what does a frozen pizza box or a twitter post or the design of a web experience tell me about the world and what it all means?

A lot of the inescapable story-telling in my brain is triggered by something I have called eyes. Visualization is one of the languages of contemporary life. If you can turn something visual, it becomes suddenly real. Information is born into tangible existence when it can be experienced with ocular acuity. Iphone just ditched its audio jack and jacked up its camera integrity. Pictures are everything.

Well, almost. I would argue that words are also powerful at telling stories sometimes. I heard someone say once that a thousand-word story is worth a picture.

With that in mind, I felt compelled to try building a visual experience for humans to talk to one another.

Far be it from me to prevent humans from talking to one another by failing to provide them with a digital place in which to do it.

It's a project designed for folks like me who sometimes find it necessary to talk to other people using their eyes and imagination rather than their mouths.

**Tl;dr.** _People need to talk. And I wanted to facilitate that by designing a web chat application using an AngularJS front-end and Firebase back-end._

That pretty much sums it up.


## The Specs

Fortunately, development also looks at solving problems in terms of stories.

I considered six different user stories as I developed this application.

* **Story 1.** Users will want to engage in straightforward authentication and their username to be displayed upon login.
* **Story 2.** Users will want to see a list of available chat rooms and easily switch between rooms.
* **Story 3.** Users will want to create their own chat rooms for specific groups.
* **Story 4.** Users will want to see the current messages listed in a given chat room, ordered reverse-chronologically.
* **Story 5.** Users will want to send messages associated with their username in a given chatroom.
* **Story 6.** Users will want to be notified visually when other users are typing a response.

Clean visualization and ease of experience will be the goal of this project. I want the simplicity of design to encourage conversation.


## The Solution

I started with a basic AngularJS framework.

I considered several wireframes while building my design.

> You should discuss your solutions and back your decisions up with conducted research. You can explain the solution to each problem separately. Provide reasoning that supports the fixes you proposed. You should also display screenshots or artifacts of your presented solutions. Include all assets created in the design or development process. Explain your work and the theory behind it. If you are working on an existing web site or application, you should show a comparison of the old and new. Discuss how your solution corrects a problem found in the former.


## Results

> Testing is a big part of the design and development process. Understanding whether or not your solutions worked is essential. Provide information about your testing process then share the results you discovered from your users. For design projects, if you have testimonials or quotes from those you interviewed and tested with, you can share those within the case study. Stakeholder interviews can also help validate your solutions, if they pertain to the business side of design.


## Conclusion

> After sharing your solutions, you should summarize your final thoughts on the project. Ask yourself the following: 

> What worked?
What didn't?
What were your doubts going into the project?
What surprised you the most?
What would you have done differently?
What did you learn while doing this project?
How will you use that information in the future?
This list of questions can help you analyze the project's success, the process you went through to complete it, and what changes you may make to your process for future projects.

> Case studies can either be long-form or short-form. Long-form case studies are time consuming, but examine every detail of your involvement in a project. Short-form case studies can provide insight into your process, but keep the information short and concise.

> Typically, professionals present case studies in a portfolio. You can also create a presentable PDF or text document to share.
